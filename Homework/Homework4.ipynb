Perhaps you add a food source for your prey to eat that is spatially randomly distributed, or maybe you add some sort of lifetime for each organism, or maybe the predators take a few steps before replicating after they've eaten their prey. You can do anything! Just explain your added rule, then implement it and explore it computationally."
